# ISS_project

The goal of this project is to track the ISS and plot its trajectory in a map.

## Part 1. Running the file ISS_project_part1.py
The user will be asked the desired interval between datapoints. To stop running, the user must press Ctrl+c. After running this a file, a csv file named results.csv is generated. This file contains the time stamp, latirude and longitude of each data point.

## Part 2. Running the file ISS_project_part2.py
This file will generate a map plot with each datapoint in results.csv. Below is an example of running the first file for about an hour with an interval of 60 seconds.
